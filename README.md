- The program needs to validate the correctness of the input DAG. A DAG with islands is valid. 
- The program holds a pool of M execution engines, each with capacity to execute only one node of the DAG at a time. M can be configurable.
- The execution engine returns failure one out of N executions. N is configurable by the server.
